Set up new repo through Github

$ gh repo clone kazoo-snarls-kinky/Pbc
$ python -m pip install Django
$ create venv

$ source venv/bin/activate

now install:
* django


Going through the setup for 'pbc' project: https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/5.0/intro/tutorial01/
"project is a collection; app is actual web app". Pbc will contain "ranking" app

Installed django-cockroachdb
Installed psycopg2 
Copied sample files from Evel

Updated database in settings.py to cockroach
TODO: create test database?

Running python manage.py migrate. Surely won't go smoothly the first time...
...wow it actually worked.

Now creating models from https://docs.google.com/document/d/14muiMHhc2bg5T067iQ_e3XTXDuQUkl6nvhM61RN25rA/edit

...models created and created the migration
* I had to solve [1]
* $ python manage.py sqlmigrate ranking 0001 reasonable

Created superuser: $ python manage.py createsuperuser
username: admin
pwd: pbcadmin
email: alojzy.rybak@gmail.com
skipped validation

TODO: Create stronger password!!!

Creating user 'karol' in the UI:
* pwd: pbckarol (had to skip pwd similarity validation)
* name and last name abbreviated
* email alojzy
* Active: yes
* Staff (can login to admin): yes
* Superuser: no
* Groups: player (there's no other group yet)

I want to modify the primary key for the player to be a human-readable string!
Django tells me I cannot do it
I try deleting the table (instead of deleting records...)
Now migration doesn't succeed because table is not there. Django doesn't know about the current database content, just knows what you applied to your app!
Found https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33259477/how-to-recreate-a-deleted-table-with-django-migrations
Okay, dropped the migration from the django_migrations table, dropped all other ranking_* tables, deleted files from migrations folder... success!

Tweaked some models a bit. Django seems quite smart about making non-backwards-compatible changes.

Playing with the admin UI to add some defaults.

First view somewhat works, with link to admin site

Created a test user that's not admin:
* test_karol, pbctesty

Added a registration/login.html template (somewhere from the internet) and added a redirect to view the matches. It works.
